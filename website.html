        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As a UX design student, I wanted to display my work in a personalized way...so why not create my own site?! All who come can see my creative process of how I go about projects from start to finish, and can get a feel of who I am as a designer. Thanks to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and a big shoutout to my mentor Evan!), here I present to you my portfolio website.</p>
        <p>Through gaining more hands-on experience with frontend development, I gained deeper understanding of design handoff to developers as I got to wear both hats and play each role. In doing so, this opened my eyes in greater appreciation to the craft of code. I am thankful to pick up these new skills and grow in knowledge and understanding in this intersection of code and design.</p>
        
        <h2>Context &amp; Challenge</h2>
        <p>In learning the foundations of frontend development, I believe that this will provide a solid link between me and other designers/developers as I can imagine the processes and workflows that would be both necesssary and helpful for design deliverables. I picked up the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a couple of months and created my portfolio website.</p>
        
        <ul><li>The Problem: I needed a space to present my design skills &amp; projects, and have a spot where I could professional connect myself with others and obtain work opportunities</li>
        <li>The Solution: A fully funtionable and responsive website</li></ul>
        
        <h2>Process &amp; Insights</h2>
        <p><u>The Design Process</u></p>
        <p>Even up until the beginning of this project, I have been looking at other portfolio websites online and took note of the different elements I liked. As I cultivated a sense of what I wanted for my own website, with inclusion of inspiration from other environments as well, I tweaked the code to have a special look for my website.</p>
        <p>I started off with the bare skeleton from the wireframes provided by my course and from there, changed bits and pieces to my liking. Formatting, layouts, colors, fonts, you name it.</p>
        
        <p><u>Learning Code</u></p>
        <p>After having a rough outline to go off of, I wrote the structure in Brackets with HTML. I styled the website with CSS, and used JavaScript for interactivity, such as for the hamburger menu when the window width gets narrows i.e. on mobile devices.</p>
        <p>To commit changes and to preview trial changes using branches, I used a repository on GitHub throughout this coding process.</p>

        alt="website_brackets">
        </picture></div>
        
        
        <p><u>UI Styling</u></p>
        <p>Styling the website was not only influenced by my personal preferernces to showcase my personality, but also had to meet accessibility standards and after receiving feedback from usability test participants, I reflected their feedback to make slight changes to the styling to make it more appealing and more functionable.</p>
        <p>Colors were updated to be AA compliant, and I focused attention on different parts to make sure information was delivered to the user in a pleasing and effective way.</p>
        <p>For example, one change I made in response to usability testing was to make the icons at thebottom of the website larger in size. They were too small before for the user to notice them easily.</p>

        <img src="img/website/website_icons.png"
        alt="website_icons">
        </picture></div>
        
        <p><u>Usability Testing</u></p>
        <p>I conducted 5 usability test interviews with people who were recruited from my personal network of friends and peers. These participants range from 20–35 years old with all technical knowledge and experience. The purpose of these interviews was to find out the user' first impressions of the website, the usability of the website's navigation and orientation, and successful locating of the designer's projects, resume, and social media account to get connected. Interviews were conducted both in person, and over Zoom calls, including screensharing.</p>
        <p>4 tasks were directed to the interview participants, and as a result, there was a general consensus of 11 iterations that were implemented for the next round of design.</p>
        <p>These were the tasks given to the participants:</p>

        alt="website_test">
        </picture></div>
        
        <p><u>Code Quality</u></p>
        <p>I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">this HTML validator</a> to achieve no errors in the code.</p>
        <p>I also tested the website for accessibility to make sure that people with sight/color limitations can use the website. I had to make a color change because the grey I chose was too light and would have blended in with the white background.</p>

        <img src="img/website/website_accessibility.png"
        alt="website_accessibility">
        </picture></div>
        
         <p>To ensure successful loads on each browser/device type, I used <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">this cross-browser testing site</a> to check.</p>
        
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <a href="https://cheriannrenee.github.io/">https://cheriannrenee.github.io/</a>
        <p>The finished product is a fully functional and responsive portfolio website that is accesible to all viewers. The website reflects my style and personality as a designer.</p>
      
        <h2>Lessons Learned &amp; Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Lessons Learned:</p>
        <ol><li>I had to voice to myself to not get so caught up in the small details in designing the website, but rather to shift my focus time and time again to the big idea of needing to aim for funcionality and usability of the website for the sake of good user experience. This needed to be kept at the forefront for me and it helped knowing that I can come back to the smaller things later on. Like they say, if it's not broken, don't fix it! (When there's bandwidth, you know I'll be coming back to enhance it!)</li>
        <li>Another lession learned is to seek help! It's ok to not know and it's more than ok to ask for help! Whether it's another Google search, or asking a developer friend, or reaching out to my mentor, it's all worth it. I'm so thankful for a supportive and helpful community, knowing that we're all in it together.</li></ol>
        <p>Next Steps:</p>
        <ul><li>Continue adding to my portfolio website &amp; elevating it as my creativity grows and pivots in different ways</li>
        <li>Take on more coding challenges to grow my skillset</li></ul></div>
